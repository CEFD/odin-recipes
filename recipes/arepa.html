    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    Arepas are cornmeal cakes that originated hundreds of years ago in a region that now makes up Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama. 
    Traditionally, they were cooked on a pan called a budare. But they can also be grilled, baked, or fried.
    </p>
    <p>Venezuelan arepas tend to be smaller and thicker, while Colombian arepas tend to be sweeter, thinner, and stuffed with cheese. 
    Our version more closely resembles Venezuelan arepas.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups Lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. Salt</li>
        <li>2 cups Pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
        <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
    </ol>
