    <h1>Caraotas</h1>

    <h2>Description</h3>
    <p>In Venezuela, black beans, called Caraotas Negras, 
        can be found simmering on the stove in kitchens throughout the country. 
        Venezuelan Black Beans are an important component of the national dish, Pabellon Criollo, served with white rice and shredded beef. Caraotas Negras 
        are also served stuffed into freshly-toasted arepas (corn patties) with shredded white cheese. 
        Recipes for Caraotas Negras vary by region and family (in central Venezuela, home cooks often add brown sugar). 
        Either way, this authentic, Venezuelan recipe is not to be missed!
