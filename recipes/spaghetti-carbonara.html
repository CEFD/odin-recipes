    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        When you're craving a comforting bowl of creamy pasta, nothing will cure you as fast as carbonara. 
        This pasta dish with Roman origins is a sure win, calling for just for a few ingredients, and done from start to finish in 20 minutes. 
        It’s basically a pantry dive – spaghetti, bacon, garlic, eggs, and parmesan are all ingredients that are easy to have on hand and don’t spoil fast. 
        As for the creaminess, it’s a misnomer that carbonara is made with cream – the creaminess comes from the silky parmesan-egg sauce, and it takes a touch of technique to get it right.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 Large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup Freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>8 Slices of bacon</li>
        <li>2 Gloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil (optional), for serving</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt (optional), for garnish</li>
        <li>Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk eggs and Parmesan until combined.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy, about 8 minutes. Reserve fat in skillet and transfer slices to a paper towel–lined plate to drain. Break into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Add garlic to skillet and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add cooked pasta and toss until fully coated in bacon fat. Remove from heat. Pour over egg-and-cheese mixture and stir vigorously until creamy (being careful not to scramble eggs). Add pasta water a few tablespoons at a time to loosen sauce.</li>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and stir in cooked bacon.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with oil and garnish with flaky sea salt (if using), Parmesan, and parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
